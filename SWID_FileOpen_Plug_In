The plug-in manages the open and print commands in the Adobe Reader according to the access controls set by the publisher. Any access controls on the encrypted files have been placed there at the discretion of the document publisher. The plug-in alone will not grant access to encrypted files; you must follow the publishers' instructions for obtaining access.">
